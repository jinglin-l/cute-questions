## Cute Questions

Cute Questions is a questions game inspired by the NYT's 36 Questions to Fall in Love but I found offers a less-cringe experience. I could not hunt down who authored the lovely questions for a proper attribution, but they are taken from [here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1K_iFxFt9lh1i0mxKRIhOSd2e8X1LNvxnihbChKXhyOc/edit?usp=drivesdk).

 Check it out here ðŸ‘‰ðŸŽ‰ [Cute Questions](https://cute-questions-cbix.vercel.app/) ðŸŽˆâœ¨.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
